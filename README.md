# SF-Crime-Visualization
Visualize San Francisco Criminal Data in Tableau

<b>Objective:</b>
Analyse San Francisco crime data to increase public safety: 
<br>Identfy the areas that are more prone to crimes? Identify at what time of the day should the Police department increase surveillance.

<br><b>Dataset:</b> Data is downloaded from DataSF.com<br>

<b>Group Members: Apporva Srinivas, Harsha Wardhan Reddy Durvv, Ritumbhara Sagar, Dan To, Pratik Khandelwal
  
<b>Analysis is done on Tableau Desktop. Data is huge, so I can't able to upload the .TWBX file on github. Instead, I have uploaded screen shot of each dashboard (from a story).
